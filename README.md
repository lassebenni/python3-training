>> Use Python3!
>> Feel free to use any editor, IDE or notebook you want. But never, NEVER, use your system `python` to avoid future problems. If not using docker images, stick to Python Virtual Environments (`venv`, `pyenv`, ...)

# Instructions
The `.key` file contains some basic information, but the heavy lifting is done on the `.ipynb` - jupyter notebooks.

## Spark
For the notebook `09-Spark.ipynb` you can use your local virtual environment. However, keep in mind that setting up spark to run on your computer can be a bit more cumbersome. For further instructions, check this [instruction guide](http://sundog-education.com/spark-python/.)

## Docker
To use the `Dockerfile`, build/pull images, run Docker containers and follow `10-DevEnvironmentDocker.opynb` you need to have the client installed locally - the Community Edition is more than enough!
For specific installation instructions:
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
* [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
* [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
* [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)
* [Building from binaries](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/binaries/)
